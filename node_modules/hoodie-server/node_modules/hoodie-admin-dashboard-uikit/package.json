It includes neat form styles, better select drop-downs with autocomplete, drag-n-drop file upload fields, better checkboxes etc. \nWe encourage the use of this kit when building your own plugins so \n\n1. you don't have to worry about styling, and \n1. all plugins have a consistent look in their admin panels\n\nIt includes a static test page of all available elements that you can copy and paste for use in your Admin Dashboard components, this is at `http://yourhoodieendpoint/_api/_plugins/_assets/index.html`.\n\n## Including the UIKit in your plugin's Admin Dashboard component\n\nPut this in the `<head>`:`<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/_api/_plugins/_assets/styles/admin-dashboard-uikit.css\">\n`\n\nAnd this before the closing `</body>` tag: `<script src=\"/_api/_plugins/_assets/scripts/admin-dashboard-uikit.js\"></script>\n`\n\nYou'll get basic styles and behaviour for a bunch of UI elements, including nicer checkboxes/radio buttons and better select dropdowns. \n\nYou can also have drag n' drop file uploads, please consultthe aforementioned `index.html` as well as `/_api/_plugins/_assets/scripts/main.js` for an example of the frontend aspect of this.\n\nIn the future, these will be part of a `my-first-plugin`-repo you can use as a base for your own plugins. Also, there will be a docs page with copy-and-pastable examples and clearer usage explanations.\n\nTo explore the UIKit further, browse through `http://yourhoodieendpoint/_api/_plugins/_assets/` (final slash matters, sorry). This base path will show you an index of all available files. \n\n## Development\n\nInstall dependencies and run the preview app on a local webserver with livereload.\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g grunt-cli bower\nnpm install\nbower install\ngrunt server\n```\n",
