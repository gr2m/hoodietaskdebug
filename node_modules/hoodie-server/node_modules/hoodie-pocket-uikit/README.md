hoodie-pocket-UIKit
===================

Pocket UIKit is a collection of CSS styles and JS libraries for easier and faster building of Pocket components for Hoodie Plugins. It includes neat form styles, better select drop-downs with autocomplete, drag-n-drop file upload fields, better checkboxes etc. 
We encourage the use of this kit when building your own plugins so 
1. you don't have to worry about styling, and 
2. all plugins have a consistent look in their admin panels

It includes a static test page of all available elements that you can copy for use in your Pocket components. 

To use this kit, include its js/css files via script/link tag from `http://yourhoodieendpoint/_api/_plugins/_assets`. This base path will show you an index of all available files. Consult the index.html file in this directory for paths and js library usage.

In the future, these will be part of a `my-first-plugin`-repo you can use as a base for your own plugins. 
Also, there will be a docs page with copy-and-pastable examples and clearer usage explanations.
